1. Make sure the 'sinatra' gem is installed.
2. From the command line, you can start the server by 'ruby main.rb'
3. If you have the 'shotgun' gem installed, you can instead run 'shotgun config.ru'. In my ubuntu 12.04-lts64 mechine, run 'shotgun main.rb', it turns out "No such file"
4. ctrl+c to stop the server
